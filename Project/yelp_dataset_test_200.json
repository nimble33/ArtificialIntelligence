It was my third visit, and I was just a tad bit disappointed.  I've previously enjoyed their shrimp & grits as a hands-down fav, but this night it wasn't as delish as in times past!  Nevertheless, the spinach artichoke dip was fresh and tastey, as was my BFF's filet & stuffed shimp.  My other friend-girl was served some of the most ginormous king crab legs I had ever seen.  And, she was kind enough to share a few butter-dipped morsels... uum uum good!  The complimentary espresso tart was just the right indulgence to share with friends.  So, all was well that ended well... especially with a 1/2 off entree for my b'day!  yeah!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}

Deny me and all hell will open up.\n\nWith that said, I was invited to LeVecchia' s for my co-worker's going away party.  I am not from Charlotte, so I popped the address in my GPS and up I-77 South I went.  I drove past this place 3 times, because you cannot see if from the street. It is inside the Hearst building (which I did not know), which you have to walk up to and there are no signs on the street, that I saw, that tell you that the restaurant is there.  \n\nFinally, I get there and immediately ask about the WhiteWater Mussels.  YES! They are Prince Edward Island! Bingo! One order please. Fifteen minutes later, our server brings out this beautiful plate of mussels. They ahd the most delicious sauce and tomato concoction ever. Yes, I shared about 5 out of the 20 I was given, but I am stingy, so the rest were mine. They were so good and meaty. They were fresh and not gritty. If only they had been a little bigger, they would have been perfect.  I love mussels.  Beware of the price through- $11.95. Not bad, but it can cut you deeply when you read the rest of the menu.\n\nThe menu selection is not that great. It's only 2 pages and it's categories are Greens (Salads), Steak and Seafood. That's it. Why isn't the selection larger? Why are the prices so high? Why does a 6 oz Filet Mignon cost $26.95?  What's going on? I know inflation is bad, but give me a break somewhere please!\n\nSince the selection was slim, I ordered the 6 oz Filet, Medium with asparagus and red wine reduction.  It was very delicious, smooth and buttery, but I am still on the fence as to if it was $26.95 delicious.  I would have loved it I could have gotten 2 more oz, but that was not an option.  I don't know yet.\n\nAll in all, our service was good for serving 15 people and the food came out in a timely manner for a party that large.  The menu selection, location and the prices are what bring it down. I have no issue paying high prices in a restaurant. Believe me, I have done it before, but I would like it to be more justified in this restaurant.  It is a good seafood option, but I have been to better as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}

First time I've ever seen a hostess at any decent restaurant sitting down smack at the entrance... something sloppy about that.  Our party of 4 decided to sit out on the patio.  We had to wait a good while before our waitress appeared (frankly we had to ask if she's our waitress as she walked right by us without acknowledging anyone), who wasn't at all enthusiastic or apologetic. She asked us for our drink order, yet we had no wine list.  She didn't even bother to light the candle that's sitting on the table.  We ended up getting the one from next table on our own.  The delivery of food was chaotic, 3 people for 4 patrons and it was all over the place.  I waited table before, 4 tops aren't difficult to manage.  Needless to say, verdict on service is: NOT GOOD, plenty of room for improvement.\n\nNow, food...  I ordered the crab cake appetizer and the crab & corn chowder.  Other items ordered were crusted halibut, stuffed shrimp and seared tuna.  I can't speak for others, but my crabcake was awful.  The crab meat was more shred-y than lumpy (to me an indication of lesser quality crab meat).  It was overly seasoned with some kind of vinaigrette based product that I barely could taste the crab.  It was simply overpowering and it was not complementary to the dish.  I never not finish my food, let alone crab cake, and I couldn't finish it.  The soup was good.  Creamy and a good balance between sweet & salty with the corn, and the crab meat was lumpier.  I tasted a bite of the halibut, it was good, but not sure if mashed potato is the best side option.  The stuffed shrimp was ok... at least the crab meat they used with the shrimp doesn't have that awful seasoning.  Verdict on food: HAD BETTER, for a restaurant that specializes in seafood, that was one disappointing crab cake.\n\nLastly, the surrounding.  We were very impressed with the patio.  For a space that overlooks the back of Connelly's... I was skeptical of sitting out there.  But it's well put together.  The big pillar actually blocks the non-scenic view.  With the nice early summer/late spring breeze, I think this was the most enjoyable part of the dinner.... that and the bread & herb garlic butter.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}

You can have mundane dishes but when your service is lack luster....you'll lose me as a fan.  I've felt better served at Chic-fil-A than this place.  Sad.  We walk in, decide on the patio to eat.  Now, as most will agree when you chose to sit in a outdoor patio area, you always gamble on service.  Easy to be forgotten outside!  We were seated right away and I will interject at this point that the patio was actually impressive given the fact there is absolutely no city view, it's was still nice and probably a good spot to have a glass of wine and lounge.  There is a fairly large sofa on the patio that appeared comfy (although untested!)  Ok, back to the service issues, we sit down and that's where the service basically ended.  Hahaha...I mean it was a solid 10-15 minutes before we were even approached by our waitress.  And her first order of business was to ask if we wanted water? Why not just bring the water out, I mean my guess is 80% of people are going to want to have a glass regardless.  After our water order she said, \"What else would you like to drink\".  I promptly responded with \"I'm really unsure considering I have no wine/specialty drink menu to look at\".  Maybe a little forward but I have no patience for untimely service, especially if it's a place that's in a niche of restaurants that's striving to be in the upper echelon.  After drinks are delivered, we ordered our food.  During the wait for the food, the couple we were dining with noted that we had a candle on the table all be it, unlit.  ??? So my friend took care of that situation by taking a nearby table's candle in exchange for ours...hahaha....love it!  \n\nSo finally our food arrives, and it's like a shuffle game, three servers, four dishes all criss crossing each of us trying to figure out who ordered what.  I think I actually laughed out loud at this moment.  \n\nIn terms of the food, personally I had the grilled yellow fin tun (medium rare) served with baby spinach and jasmine rice.  No here, I can't complain, the tuna was fantastic, the rice was very light and the spinach was cooked to perfection.  I received another CPA (clean plate award) yay me!  \n\nSo in breaking it down:\n\nAtmosphere - 3 stars\nService - 1 star\nFood - 4 star \n\nThat's a 2.6 star average so bump it on up to 3 stars I suppose.  \n\nNote:  Right now you can get a $25 off certificate for 2 entree's for this location on Restaurant.com.  Does that make it worth it? Meh.....not IMO.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}

However, that was not the case for me.  We got two differing copies of the restaurant week menus, and our server merely looked at them briefly before telling us to order whatever we'd like off of either and she'd handle it.  They were also out of the wine we ordered, and she brought us a better bottle and charged us the less expensive price.  She was attentive but not intrusive throughout and more or less fell all over herself to make sure we knew how much she appreciated we were understanding of the \"mistakes\".  It's rare for a waiter to go so above and beyond to make sure I'm happy.\n\nThe food- decent for upscale.  I had calamari (average) and a ribeye that was cooked exactly like a medium-rare steak should be.  My dining partner had tilapia, and I will not judge a restaurant based on the presentation of that boring ass fish.

Not all of our party was there so we were told we could wait in the building lobby and they would get our table ready soon.  At 7:45 we were still waiting, everyone was there and I had watched them seat several other tables who said they had no reservations.  So, I asked about our table and the hostess rolled her eyes and sighed and said they were still working on it.  When I mentioned that our reservation had been for earlier, she said \"well, everyone else had reservations, too, Ma'am!\" and just walked off.  I promptly labeled her the anit-hostess and another member of our party (of 5) went to find the front house manager.\n\nThe manager seated us but acted like he did us this huge favor.  We were seated in the bar, next to the patio door, so we had the bracing blasts of cold air throughout our meal as staff went in and out this door all night long.\n\nOur waiter was in no hurry to take care of us.  Once we ordered our drinks, he never came back with any more water, and one member of our party had to flag him down each time he wanted another beer.  \n\nOur food finally came and at last, redemption!!

Everyone oohed and ahhed over our meals.  \n\nPrice point wise I feel we got what we paid for strictly in terms of food and food quality.  The presentation was lovely, temp was good...

The hostess was rude and off-putting from the moment we arrived and when we were seated commented that they \"worked it out\" for us, like she had to prove something. I still don't know exactly what her deal was.\n\nBottom line:  If you want me to pay $200 for a meal, you need to act like you're glad I showed up.  Drop the bad attitude and step it up.

The server came by with bread and did not say a thing.  My salad finally arrives.  A few minutes later the server returns and mentions she is glad to see that I have my salad now and was wondering what happened to it.  Both the soup and the salad were good, but to eat starters separately should not happen.  After finishing, I finally get my bar drink, the server appologizes for it taking so long.\n\nNext to courses.  Kevin had lobster pasta and I had steak.  My steak was dropped off, but no steak knife was dropped off by our waiter, the person who dropped off the food, or anyone.  Waiter no where in sight, I flag down someone for a steak knife.  Aside from that, the steak was good, had a nice flavor.  Kevin liked his, but did not think it was anything special.\n\nWe finish the main course and are waiting around for some time, our waiter comes by and asks us if we want boxes, we say yes.  A couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts. He asked us of we were still working on our dinners, suprised to see them on the table.  We told him we were waiting on boxes.  He takes them away to box them.  A few minutes later our waiter comes with boxes, and is surprised to see our food gone.  Aside from that, the desserts were good.  The chocolate cake was rich, but great!\n\nOverall, I was not blown away by the food, and since the service and experience was awful, I will not be back.  If I'm going to pay a lot of money for dinner, it should all be great.  It was just like going to a mediocre restaurant, felt nothing like an upscale restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TLrX4FECQDFz-E45TI_9ow"}

Everyone else got legitimate entrees, and mine was the best value--I had more food than they did.  They all seemed to enjoy their selections, since we all finished our dinner.  The only low spot was one of the diners got the chocolate cake and didn't like it...probably because she waited so long to eat it because she was gossiping.

North Carolina's laws on serving alcohol make it nearly impossible to just open a \"club\", so you see a lot of these in Charlotte, especially downtown.  \n\nThe staff is super friendly and doesn't hassle you for walking in and realizing \"Saturday night\" hasn't started yet because the dining patrons still haven't cleared out.  So don't be afraid to check it at 11pm and then come back again at midnight or 1 if it's still slow.  I've never been here to eat but it's a great place to stop in for a late night weekend drink to see what's going on.  People dress nice and behave well.  So you can actually get an expensive drink and not worry about someone elbowing it across the room.  \n\nThere's plenty of seating on both the first and second floors and they have a respectable, if predictable, Scotch selection that helps me keep them in mind when I'm downtown, so I'm sure the rest of the liquor options are pretty good.  Coming from  Illinois where you can buy booze at grocery stores, it's depressing to walk into a bar in Charlotte and only have one or two choices.

Out of the reviews that are on here it looks like most were geared toward the night life, which we didn't stick around for. We came solely to try the food. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded so good, and they had a decent range of dishes for you to choose from, with the countries that the dish is from written on the side of each choice. I think it would be hard to come here and have a hard time finding something that sounds good to you, even for the pickiest of eaters. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and had our drinks out pretty quickly, and she was great at helping us choose which dishes to go with. For appetizer we had the crab con queso - you MUST get this!! I can't even tell you how good it was, you just need to go experience it yourself. It was a crab dip blended together with cheeses, (hence, the name), and it was amazing. They serve it with nachos, and the waitress made a joke about how she literally needed to pry it from our hands because our entrees were about ready to come out and she wanted to clear our table. We also got the Dim Sum as an app, which were basically shrimp dumplings, and they came with a thai peanut dipping sauce that was very tasty. \n\nThen our entrees came out - Oh my Wild Mushroom Ravioli! I have to admit that when it first came out I was doubtful, because it didn't look like much, but it was a deep dish and the raviolis were a decent size. The mushroom brown sauce that the ravs were buried in was out of control. SO good. My fiancee ordered the Tuna Filet Mignon, rare, and it was excellent (of course I saved room for a sample). The only thing that wasn't so good was the \"mashed potatoes\" surrounded the filet, and I put it in quotations because they were definitely questionable. They tasted totally artificial, and if you hadn't told me they were mashed potatoes I would be stuck wondering what it was. Looked like someone stuck microwaveable cauliflower mystery mix and stuffed it through a pastry gun to make it look pretty. I'd order the dish but skip the \"mash\". \n\nOur bill came and we were pretty stunned that we had drinks, 2 apps, and two entrees, and it was only around $60. Definitely not bad! We will be back for sure, for dinner and to stick around for the night scene. We also liked how it had a casual vibe, yet everyone was dressed really nice. Just as a side-note about uptown: I am finding that about a lot of the places we visit; everyone looks really good, the girls dress so cute, but it's not uptight.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5J3s-xxs1S6PPHJhldBEA"}

There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers), so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more. \n\nI've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome, so if you're into that you may wanna try them.

It feels trendy, but isn't pretentious like some Uptown restaurants.  It's a great place to casually go before or after an Uptown show or event, especially if you can get there between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. during the week because their tapas/appetizers are half-price!  Woo hoo!   And if we're lucky enough to go on a Wednesday evening, we can combine the half-price apps with half-price martinis.  You can really fill up on some gourmet food and classy, flavorful martinis...for cheap!   It does tend to get pretty crowded, though, on Wednesdays, so allow yourself enough time to be seated and get served all within that timeframe.  \n\nTheir regular menu is excellent, too.  They have gourmet American items, as well as a full sushi menu.  Their sushi is excellent and that's usually what I get if we're not there during happy hour.  The sushi can't beat places like Ru-San's or Nikko, but it's still pretty darn good...and very reasonably priced!  \n\nMy only disappointment with Cosmos Cafe would be that we went there once for my birthday (because that's where I wanted to go).  One of my friends made a reservation in advance and we were seated in a room by ourselves off to the side (their party room, I'm assuming).  Being in there  lost the atmosphere of Cosmos, but that wasn't all that went wrong.  We were handed limited menus.  There was some kind of event or show going on that night in Uptown (when isn't there anymore?) and Cosmos was providing a limited menu with only a few simple items (not even their gourmet options) so they could get people in and out quicker.

We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. \n\nAnyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. \n\nThe issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. \n\nAfter looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] \n\nTo add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an \"exclusive club\" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. \n\nVibe: Dead\nFood: Decent\nDrinks: Typical selection\nDrink price: $5 for a beer. [Mid range for downtown]\n\nWould I go here again? No. Absolutely not.\n\nI've been to the ballantyne location twice, and I can't say that's a bad place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5J3s-xxs1S6PPHJhldBEA"}

First of all, quick note about the movie itself - believe the hype. It is that good. Now, onto the theatre...\n\nThis was our second attempt at going, our first being Sunday night, but unfortunately it was sold out then. They open 45 minutes before showtime, and we got there to find a long line of people who we thought were waiting to purchase tickets - turns out they had all purchased way earlier, the showing had been sold out for hours and they were just waiting to get in and claim their seats. Smart move. We followed suit yesterday. The one thing you want to make sure of when you are going here is that you get there early to ensure a seat in the middle. We were fortunate, and set right in the center of the theatre. \n\nI can't imagine people's experiences who sat in the not-so-good seating area, like the way front, or all the way up top or out to the sides. The first thing we said upon leaving was, \"Wow, we need to go back and see it on the regular screen.\" I was unaware until last night that apparently there is a difference between IMAX, and IMAX DOME, which this theatre is. I always remember IMAX as a huge screen that makes you feel like you are almost in the showing, traveling around with the characters. The Dome wraps the picture all the way around the theatre and onto the ceiling so you are looking up at it. This sounds awesome, but this made it very difficult to fully experience the film.  I'm sad to say that the fight scenes were completely lost on me - they move so fast that they make you dizzy in IMAX, and it's impossible to see everything because the screen spans so wide that you miss what's going on on the sides.  If you get dizzy easily, it'd probably be a wise decision to skip this. \n\nOverall, this was a great experience and I will definitely return to see the other great showings, like Pompeii, and Greece, but as for the movies like this, I'll take it to the original big screen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA"}

I was thrilled that it was right here in Charlotte. \n\nMy second trip was with my 4 year old niece to let her enjoy all the kid-friendly permanent exhibits, and she had a great time. She especially enjoyed the big pendulum that you can use to draw that's by the main entrance to the museum...although we had to wait in line behind the other kids, which wasn't a lot of fun. \n\nI also went to see A Night at the Museum in their IMax theater. I thought it would be a good one to see, but it was a little overwhelming in that it wasn't truly an IMax film...it was just a regular movie shown BIG. If I go back to see another IMax, I'll see a film designed for the theater. I went to an IMax film at the dome in Galveston, Texas a few years ago, and it was awesome. Even though my experience in Discovery Place's theater wasn't as breathtaking, I am glad that we have one in town.\n\nI also recently checked out the Pompeii exhibit, which was a lot of fun. I've been to Pompeii before, and even so, this exhibit was worth checking out, and I saw things that I didn't see on the tour of the ruins. The plaster casts of the people and animals are poignant, but the other artifacts are surprisingly interesting, and the art is beautiful. \n\nI wish the parking wasn't so pricey, but overall, Discovery Place is a great resource here in town.

Here is a video with one of the live science experiments (blowing off a balloon):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/v/EYZlLbf80JI\n\n* Everybody goes nuts for the live Rats Basketball Game...however it's more of a hit and miss when exactly they have it open.\n\nThere are several PARKING options:\n* Use the museum garage parking ($7 day flat rate fee) and walk straight into the museum.\n\n* Park in the garage across the street from the museum ($5 day flat rate fee Fri and Sat)\n\n* Use the metered parking spots along the streets. Good luck finding one!\n\nFood is not that great, cafeteria style. Hamburgers, fried and grilled chicken sandwiches and small size pizzas. Also soups, yogurt, pudding and salad boxes.

They might like different activities- but there is something for each of them.\n\nMy 13 year old nephew discovered his love of mechanics while at Discovery Place. That is seriously worth every penny. Someone working there spent extra time with my nephew- showing him how to take apart and put back together a robot. Very awesome.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA"}

The free 3-D movie on Bugs was SUPER COOL, spiders hanging right in front of your face and close up shots of the metamorphosis of caterpillars. Kids and parents were on their best behavior for the most part, waiting turns and being polite. There is also a cool water area and kids play area for the super young ones so you can bring your whole family! You could make creations from paper and fabric and email them to yourself. Or take pictures of something like a fossil through a magnifying glass and email it to yourself. So high-tech! One of the most fun things we did while we were there was match the poop to the animal - not as easy as you would think!

WOW!!! To think these mummies were all found in the basement of a German museum that were thought to be destroyed during WWII. These mummies date back from several thousand to over six thousand years ago and come from all over the world, just not Egypt. This exhibit has some of the oldest mummies in the world, including mummies thousands of years older than King Tut!! The oldest mummy was that of a child that was 6,500 years old and had some amazing detail. There was a female mummy with long hair and tattoos.\nThe exhibit also contains animal mummies and all sorts of artifacts that were found with the mummies, like mummy powder of ground up mummies that was used as medicine, tools used during the mummification process or jars used to store the organs that had been removed.\nAlthough the exhibit has already been here for 3 months, it was still very crowded, but most people used their manners if they bumped into or stepped in front of you. If you enjoy this type of history, My wife and I highly reccomend this exhibition. Admission is $24 per person which includes the mummies, $12 per person without the mummies.\nAs far as the rest of Discovery Place, most of it geared toward kids, and there was alot of them, but the parents seemed to keep things under control.

The renovations are nice, but most of the exhibits have not changed tremendously.  The draws for the adults are definitely the movies and the touring exhibits.  I have seen most of the ones they have hosted in the past 10 years except for A Day in Pompeii.  Body Worlds was fascinating as was the current \"Mummies of the World\".  That exhibit alone definitely would warrant 5 stars if it could be reviewed separately.  It's only here until 4/8/2012, so go see while you can.\n\nThe museum still has the rainforest - not much has changed in it.  The aquarium area is a little nicer and brighter.  The exhibits on the main floor are also somewhat similar, but upgraded.  The price of admission is $12 for adults for just the museum and was $24 for the Mummies exhibit, which included museum admission.That was nice because we had to wait about an hour or so for our scheduled time to see the exhibit.  \n\nAll in all, Discovery Place is a great place for kids, but it can also be enjoyed by adults.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZBQWSsUXwixFmm3lpegMiA"}

Hot or cold, healthy or cupcakes, you can find something to please even the pickiest of eaters.  There are two entrances (one on 6th Street, one on Tryon), and if the line is too crowded at one, I suggest checking out the other (when we were there, 40 people must have been waiting in line at 6th Street, but upstairs on Tryon was empty).

My kids give it five stars and I give it three.  Average out to 4 stars. For those who like a little more meat on the bone, here goes. Everything here seems to be clean and in good working order (but with all the kids running around sneezing, this place is bacterial/viral city). Areas to build with blocks and learn about architecture. Quite a few interactive exhibits teaching everything from air pressure, different forces/physics  and animation. A science theatre area where experiments are performed. Additionally small carts go around with smaller participatory experiments. A small rainforest area and exhibit with frogs. Downstairs there is a small aquarium and a hands on area, where you can view items under a microscope or pet a horseshoe crab. Most people know that there is an IMAX as well, but that is a separate fee from the General Admission fee. Kids love this place.  Now my gripe. Admission for two adults and two kids is about $60. For 1.5 floors of exhibits I did not find much value. There was nothing for me as a parent other than enjoying the smiles on my children's faces. Really guys? I pay you to chaperone my own children. Either charge the adults and not the kids, or charge the kids and not the adults. And children's admission starts at age 2. Even Disney will cut you a better break than that. My interactions with the ticket counter made me feel like this place was a little bit \"money centered\"; they were very \"huffy\" and impatient with me.

Wow, how time changes a place.  My kids were bored...I mean INSANELY bored, and I have very inquisitive and intelligent children!  The very few exhibits that were interesting were covered over by kids who didn't know the meaning of the words \"taking turns\", whose parents were over in the corner on their assorted electronic devices.  This place is little more than a overhyped daycare now.  All the cool things I did and enjoyed as an adolescent were replaced with \"rooms\" that had microscopes that barely worked, a hands-on exhibit of water creatures that for some strange reason my kids weren't allowed to touch for more than two seconds by the employee manning the exhibit, despite some of the other children splashing around in the water and making a mess.  We severely overpaid for a grand total of ninety minutes of sheer boredom.  We honestly tried, but other than the building blocks in a supposed \"architecture\" exhibit that was taken over by adult Frank Lloyd Wright-wannabes, leaving few bricks for the actual kids to use, there was little to do.
